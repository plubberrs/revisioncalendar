A web application on my website. This app lets you enter a topic that you learn on a certain today, and calculates when best to review the material based on combatting the forgetting curve. I made this primarily to learn about putting together a web application with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL. {Here}[https://codeshack.io/event-calendar-php/] is where I got the main frameworks from.
